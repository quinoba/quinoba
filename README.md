## About me:

- People usually calls me Quino.
- I was born and raised in the south of Mexico City.
- My pronouns are he/him.
- I studied Economics at [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/en). 
- I am a huge fan of one of my city's local football teams: [Cruz Azul](https://www.cruzazulfc.com.mx/).
- I wrote my undergrad thesis on Water Pollution Spillovers and Cooperation in Mexico.
  - In particular, my thesis analyzes cooperation as an alternative solution to pollution spillovers in natural resources. 
  Rivers are a classic textbook example of externalities, pollution from upstream communities is greater than socially optimal pollution since the negative effects
  will be borne by the downstream communities. Cooperation can incentivize upstream communities to take costly actions to reduce their pollution, thus benefiting 
  downstream communities.
  - My paper proxies cooperation between communities using a variable that measures the political party alignment of majors in neighboring municipalities. 
  - With a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Mexico and GIS modeling, I determine the direction of the flow of the country's rivers and determine which communities 
  are upstream and which are downstream.
  - I still have a lot of work ahead of me, but once I'm done I'll share a [repository](https://github.com/quinoba/Spillovers_Cooperation) on this with some cool maps and my R code.
