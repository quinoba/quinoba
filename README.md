## About me:

- People usually calls me Quino.
- I was born and raised in the south of Mexico City.
- My pronouns are he/him.
- I studied Economics at [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/en). 
- I am a huge fan of one of my city's local football teams: [Cruz Azul](https://www.cruzazulfc.com.mx/).
- You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/j_barrutia).
- I wrote my undergrad thesis on Water Pollution Spillovers and Cooperation in Mexico.
  - In particular, my thesis analyzes cooperation as an alternative solution to pollution spillovers in natural resources. 
  Rivers are a classic textbook example of externalities, pollution from upstream communities is greater than socially optimal pollution since the negative effects
  will be borne by the downstream communities. Cooperation can incentivize upstream communities to take costly actions to reduce their pollution, thus benefiting 
  downstream communities.
  - Using a political alignment dichotomous variable that indicates whether the political party of two mayors in neighboring municipalities is the same my paper tries to investigate whether political alignment can foster cooperation between municipalities. 
  - With a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Mexico and GIS modeling, I determine the direction of the flow of the country's rivers and determine which communities 
  are upstream and which are downstream from each other.
  - My thesis shows evidence that water quality in mexican rivers improves on average in contexts where cooperation is fostered.
  - You can have a look at my thesis and my R Markdown and replicabilty data in this [repository](https://github.com/quinoba/Spillovers_Cooperation).
